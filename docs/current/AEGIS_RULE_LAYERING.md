# Aegis Rule Layering

Status: `Approved`

## 1. Document Scope

This document defines the layered boundaries of the current `Aegis` rule system.

This document is only responsible for answering the following questions:

- Which rules belong to the portable method layer core
- Which rules belong to host / profile preferences
- Which rules belong to the current repository's contribution constraints

---

## 2. Three-Layer Rule Model

### 2.1 Portable Method Rules

Rules suitable for entry into the `Aegis Method Pack` core include:

- TLREF
- DIVE
- Reflection
- QA
- Evidence-Driven
- Dual-Track Governance
- Output Contract

### 2.2 Host / Profile Rules

Rules that should not be directly written into the general method-pack baseline include:

- `sequential-thinking`
- Preferring `serena` / `context7`
- Host-specific tool routing
- Assembly methods unique to a particular plugin platform

These rules should enter:

- Host adapter docs
- Host-specific profile
- Install / usage guide

Bootstrap adapters must stay thin. A host adapter may decide activation mode,
TDD mode, JSON shape, skill discovery path, legacy warnings, and host tool
mapping, but it should source the portable hot path from
`skills/using-aegis/SKILL.md` or a host-native reference to that file. It should
not copy the full skill body into a separate prompt owner, replace
task-specific skills with one large fixed prompt, or grant runtime /
completion authority.

### 2.3 Repo Contribution Rules

Rules that only constrain current repository contributions and local implementation include:

- File length limits
- Naming conventions
- Repository security and commit constraints
- Document placement constraints

These rules should not be automatically elevated to cross-host general methodology.

## 3. Current Owners And Manual Projections

The current portable routing owner is `skills/using-aegis/SKILL.md`. Detailed
workflow behavior remains owned by the task-specific skills and approved
current docs. Activation and TDD mode semantics are owned by
`AEGIS_ACTIVATION_MODE.md` and `AEGIS_TDD_MODE.md` respectively.

The root `GLOBAL_USER_RULES_TEMPLATE.md` and
`GLOBAL_USER_RULES_TEMPLATE.zh-CN.md` files are English and Chinese mirrors of
one manual host/profile routing prefix. They are not method owners, host
adapters, or proof that Aegis is installed and discoverable. They are not
updated by `aegis:update`; users must re-copy or merge them when a release
changes the projected routing semantics.

The routing prefix may retain only the stable host/profile integration needed
before a task-specific skill owns the workflow: activation-mode entry, minimal
skill loading, fast-path behavior, context re-entry, and the distinction
between Activation Mode and TDD Mode. It must not duplicate planning,
debugging, TDD execution, verification, governance, output contracts, exact
skill output shapes, or host-specific tool routing.

Projection maintenance follows these rules:

- Keep one functional routing-prefix profile with aligned English and Chinese
  mirrors; do not reintroduce Lite / Advanced capability tiers.
- Keep detailed workflow governance owned by `skills/using-aegis/SKILL.md`,
  task-specific skills, and approved current docs instead of projecting it into
  global user rules.
- The former `GLOBAL_USER_RULES_LITE*` files are retired duplicate profiles.
  Existing manual copies should replace only their old Aegis Lite / Advanced
  blocks with the unified prefix; unrelated pre-existing global rules remain
  unchanged.
- Keep shared semantics aligned across English and Chinese without requiring
  byte-for-byte translation.
- When activation, TDD, routing, priority, verification, or authority semantics
  change, review both language mirrors and publish a manual-copy migration
  note.

## 4. Design Constraints

Any subsequent rule addition must first answer:

1. Is it portable across hosts
2. Does it depend on specific tool capabilities
3. Does it only serve current repository contributions

Only the first category is permitted to enter the method-pack core.
