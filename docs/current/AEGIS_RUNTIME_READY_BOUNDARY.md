# Aegis Runtime-Ready Boundary

Status: `Approved`

## 1. Document Scope

This document defines the minimum boundary between the current `Aegis Method Pack` and the future `Aegis Runtime Core`.

This document is only responsible for answering the following questions:

- Which runtime-ready artifacts can this repository stably produce
- Which authoritative outputs this repository must NOT adjudicate
- How the method layer, host projection layer, and runtime core should collaborate

This document is NOT responsible for answering the following questions:

- Node-level execution implementation of the runtime core
- Transport or API details of host adapters
- Database storage structures

---

## 2. Bottom Line Up Front

The goal of this repository is not to become a runtime core, but to become:

> A `runtime-ready method pack` that can stably produce governance inputs and governance projections

Therefore:

- This repository can generate drafts, templates, checklists, and artifact conventions
- This repository can require hosts to provide necessary missing information
- This repository can output advisory, warning-style process guidance
- This repository can output an on-demand `Trace Digest` as advisory
  transparency over observed execution, evidence, rule effects, skill routing,
  verification, and host capability gaps
- This repository must NOT independently produce authoritative `GateDecision`
- This repository must NOT independently grant `completion authority`

---

## 3. Runtime-Ready Artifacts This Repository Can Produce

This repository is permitted and encouraged to produce the following artifacts:

### 3.1 `TaskIntentDraft`

Minimum fields:

- `requestedOutcome`
- `scope`
- `changeKinds`
- `riskHints`

Optional goal-framing fields:

- `goal`
- `successEvidence`
- `stopCondition`
- `nonGoals`

Purpose:

- Help the host and future runtime core establish unified task framing
- Make done, blocked, needs-verification, and scope-exceeded boundaries explicit
  before execution when the user invokes `/aegis-goal` or `Aegis goal:`

### 3.2 `BaselineReadSetHint`

Minimum fields:

- `candidateDocs`
- `whyRelevant`
- `missingAuthority`

Purpose:

- Indicate which baseline documents should be read first for the current task
- Expose authority gaps

### 3.3 `BaselineUsageDraft`

Minimum fields:

- `taskId`
- `requiredBaselineRefs`
- `acknowledgedBeforePlanRefs`
- `citedInPlanRefs`
- `missingRefs`
- `decision`

Optional host-projected fields:

- `deliveredContextRefs`

Purpose:

- Expose whether required baseline refs were acknowledged before planning and
  later cited in plan/verification outputs
- Keep baseline/context attention drift visible without asserting authoritative
  host injection observability or internal model-attention proof

### 3.4 `ImpactStatementDraft`

Minimum fields:

- `affectedLayers`
- `owners`
- `invariants`
- `compatBoundary`
- `nonGoals`

Purpose:

- Make high-risk tasks explicitly expose impact surface and compatibility boundaries before execution
- Carry Ripple Signal Triage results when a pre-change signal indicates downstream, owner, source-of-truth, contract, fallback, or verification-scope risk

### 3.5 `EvidenceBundleDraft`

Minimum fields:

- `artifactKey`
- `type`
- `source`
- `summary`
- `verifier`

Purpose:

- Unify the naming and minimum structure of evidence collection

### 3.6 `GateInputPack`

Minimum fields:

- `baselineRefs`
- `impactStatement`
- `compatPlan`
- `retirementPlan`
- `evidenceBundle`

Purpose:

- Serve as the minimum input package for the future runtime core
- May be rendered as a human-readable `Execution Readiness View` before
  implementation begins. That view compresses the current intent, scope fence,
  baseline refs, owner / contract constraints, compatibility boundary,
  retirement boundary, task batches, test obligations, review gates, drift /
  rewind rules, and evidence required before completion.
- The rendered view is advisory method-pack execution guidance only. It is not
  an authoritative `GateDecision`, `PolicySnapshot`, or completion authority.

### 3.7 `TodoCheckpointDraft`

Minimum fields:

- `taskId`
- `currentTodo`
- `completedTodos`
- `activeSlice`
- `evidenceRefs`
- `blockedOn`
- `nextStep`
- `updatedAt`

Purpose:

- Enable long tasks to have recoverable todo / checkpoint state before and after each execution slice

### 3.8 `ResumeStateHint`

Minimum fields:

- `taskId`
- `lastCheckpointRef`
- `resumeInstruction`
- `knownPartialWork`
- `mustReadBeforeContinuing`
- `unsafeToAssume`

Purpose:

- Provide a minimal re-entry point during session resumption, context compression, or agent handoff

### 3.9 `DriftCheckDraft`

Minimum fields:

- `taskId`
- `taskIntentRef`
- `baselineRefs`
- `scopeStatus`
- `compatStatus`
- `retirementStatus`
- `newRiskSignals`
- `decision`

Purpose:

- Explicitly check whether goals, baselines, compatibility boundaries, and retirement tracks have drifted during long task execution
- When an `Execution Readiness View` exists, compare the active slice against
  that view before continuing after resume, compaction, handoff, or meaningful
  scope change. If intent, scope fence, baseline refs, compatibility boundary,
  retirement boundary, test obligations, or review gates no longer align,
  return to planning or refresh the advisory handoff instead of improvising new
  behavior.

### 3.10 `SubagentContextPacket`

Minimum fields:

- `task`
- `goal`
- `stopCondition`
- `relevantBaselineRefs`
- `relevantFiles`
- `knownFacts`
- `unknowns`
- `nonGoals`
- `expectedOutput`
- `verificationExpected`
- `mustReadExcerpts`
- `unsafeAssumptions`

Purpose:

- Provide a compact delegation packet for subagents without inheriting full
  conversation context
- Require critical facts to stay tied to bounded evidence excerpts that the
  subagent may verify directly

### 3.11 `Execution Readiness View`

`Execution Readiness View` is a human-readable rendering of existing
runtime-ready drafts, not a new authoritative artifact type.

Minimum source inputs:

- `TaskIntentDraft`
- `BaselineUsageDraft`
- `ImpactStatementDraft`
- `GateInputPack`
- task plan or `Slice Card`
- expected verification / evidence refs

Minimum view shape:

- `Intent Lock`
- `Scope Fence`
- `Baseline Lock`
- `Approved Behavior`
- `Owner / Contract Constraints`
- `Compatibility Boundary`
- `Retirement Boundary`
- `Task Batches`
- `Test Obligations`
- `Review Gates`
- `Drift / Rewind Rules`
- `Evidence Required Before Completion`
- `Advisory Boundary`

Purpose:

- Give executors and subagents a compact plan-to-execution handoff that does
  not rely on chat memory.
- Make drift checks concrete before implementation, resume, or handoff.
- Keep `GateInputPack` consumable by a future runtime core while giving humans
  and current hosts a readable advisory projection.

Boundary:

- It is method-pack execution guidance only.
- It must not use final adjudication language such as `gate-passed`,
  `completion-granted`, `authoritatively-safe`, or `approved by Aegis`.
- It does not grant permission to commit, merge, publish, release, or perform
  destructive actions.

## 4. Authoritative Outputs This Repository Must NOT Adjudicate

The following outputs can only be the responsibility of the future `Aegis Runtime Core`:

- Authoritative `BaselineRef[]`
- Authoritative `PolicySnapshot`
- Authoritative `ImpactStatement`
- Authoritative `GateDecision`
- Final classification of `architecture_drift / defect / corrosion`
- Final determination of `evidence sufficiency`
- Treating `Trace Digest` as an authoritative event log, policy decision, or
  completion grant
- `completion authority`

No method-pack skill, host prompt, or projection template may overstep by claiming to already possess these capabilities.

---

## 5. Three-Layer Collaboration Model

The currently recommended collaboration model is:

### 5.1 Method Pack

Responsible for:

- Organizing problem definition
- Organizing artifact generation
- Outputting reminders, templates, checklists, and review structures

Not responsible for:

- Final governance adjudication

### 5.2 Host Projection / Future Adapter

Responsible for:

- Collecting raw context from the host
- Extracting raw evidence such as files, commands, tests, diffs, and logs
- Mapping method-pack artifacts and host events into unified governance inputs
- Projecting runtime core outputs into host-consumable prompts or blocks

Not responsible for:

- Independently replicating a set of authoritative gate logic

### 5.3 Runtime Core

Responsible for:

- Baseline truth
- Policy snapshot
- Authoritative impact analysis
- Gate decision
- Evidence sufficiency
- Completion authority

---

## 6. Current Operating Mode

Before the runtime core is independently landed, this repository is only permitted to adopt:

> `Advisory-first, runtime-ready`

This means:

- This repository can make hosts "work more like Aegis"
- This repository can make processes more rigorous and more evidence-driven
- This repository must NOT misrepresent process discipline as system authority

---

## 7. Drift Signals

When the following phenomena appear, it indicates that the current boundary is being eroded:

- Skill text begins directly outputting `pass / block / granted` as final adjudication
- The host side claims "governance-complete" simply because tests passed or a process ended
- This repository's docs refer to draft artifacts as authoritative records
- For convenience, runtime logic is directly stuffed back into the method pack repository

---

## 8. Current Constraints

All subsequent skill modifications related to gate, impact, verification, and review must comply with:

- May produce drafts
- May produce hints
- May produce projections
- Must NOT produce overstepping authority
