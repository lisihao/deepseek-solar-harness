# Aegis Known Limitations

Status: `Reviewed`

## 1. Document Scope

This document records the current known limitations, compatibility fallbacks, retention reasons, and retirement triggers of the `Aegis Method Pack`.

It only records limitations supported by current fresh evidence and does not speculate about the future.

---

## 2. Current Known Limitations

### 2.1 Current Repository Is Not a Complete Platform

**Retained Item**
- The layered boundary between `Method Pack` and future `Host Adapters + Runtime Core`

**Retention Reason**
- The current repository's formal scope is `Aegis Method Pack (runtime-ready)`, not a full platform

**Observation Metric**
- Whether current docs still constrain outputs to `draft / hint / projection`

**Retirement Trigger**
- Only when a future complete platform is independently unfolded in a new approved plan does this enter the next layer; this is not about "deleting this limitation"

---

### 2.2 Real-Environment Regression Is Deferred

**Retained Item**
- Multi-host release-level fresh install regression
- Real team task live sample verification

**Retention Reason**
- The current priority is method-pack strengthening and open-source preparation, not immediately declaring daily production rollout

**Observation Metric**
- Whether the release checklist and host compatibility snapshot still clearly distinguish method-pack readiness from production rollout readiness

**Retirement Trigger**
- When the user explicitly requests entry into production rollout preparation

---

### 2.3 OpenCode Config Fallback Is Still Retained

**Retained Item**
- OpenCode `config.skills.paths` compatibility fallback

**Retention Reason**
- The current canonical chain has already switched to the host's officially supported global skills path, but cross-version evidence that the fallback has zero compatibility value is still lacking
- When `~/.config/aegis/config.toml` declares `method_pack_root`, the OpenCode
  plugin now treats that configured checkout as the canonical Aegis source and
  generates the OpenCode-visible skills tree from it; the host-visible skills
  directory is still a compatibility view rather than a second editable owner,
  and `config.skills.paths` remains only a fallback exposure layer

**Observation Metric**
- `bash tests/opencode/run-tests.sh --integration`
- Real fresh install verification

**Retirement Trigger**
- When the target OpenCode version set has proven that the native global skills path is sufficiently stable

---

### 2.4 Current Host Snapshot Is Not a Full-Host Release Verdict

**Retained Item**
- Currently only `Codex` and `OpenCode` have fresh-evidence-driven mainline verdicts

**Retention Reason**
- Other hosts are currently outside the verification scope of this slice

**Observation Metric**
- Whether `AEGIS_HOST_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX_SNAPSHOT.md` still clearly distinguishes "has fresh evidence" from "current verdict not yet formed"

**Retirement Trigger**
- When other hosts enter a separate approved slice and complete fresh closeout

---

### 2.5 Codex Smoke Under Git Bash: Latency and Stability Require Separate Observation

**Retained Item**
- Codex representative smoke under Git Bash / MSYS2 environment

**Retention Reason**
- It has been confirmed that the working-dir / cmd bridge issues under Git Bash can be converged, but representative Codex smoke may still exhibit:
  - explicit skill requests may pass but take longer than expected
  - naive prompt smoke is unstable within the current timeout window
  - on some Windows Codex installations, the default workspace sandbox may
    fail before routing when it cannot spawn the configured PowerShell process
    (`CreateProcessAsUserW` access denied); an environment-controlled rerun can
    distinguish that host failure from an Aegis trigger regression

**Observation Metric**
- `env AEGIS_TEST_CLI=codex bash tests/explicit-skill-requests/run-test.sh brainstorming ...`
- `env AEGIS_TEST_CLI=codex bash tests/skill-triggering/run-test.sh brainstorming ...`
- Bridge and parser behavior of `tests/helpers/codex-cli.sh`
- Whether the same smoke reaches skill discovery with and without the failing
  Windows sandbox boundary

**Retirement Trigger**
- When representative Codex smoke under Git Bash passes stably within the
  current runner timeout window and the Windows sandbox can reliably spawn its
  configured shell

---

### 2.6 INDEX.md Append Dependency on Workflow Steps

**Retained Item**
- The completeness of `docs/aegis/INDEX.md` still depends on workflows using the shared workspace helper or explicitly performing the append operation

**Retention Reason**
- `scripts/aegis-workspace.py` now provides lifecycle commands (`new-work`, `add-checkpoint`, `add-evidence`, `add-drift-check`, `bundle`) and `append-index`, and `check` detects unindexed markdown. A workflow that writes to `docs/aegis/` must still call the helper or manually append the entry

**Observation Metric**
- `bash tests/e2e/aegis-workspace-check.sh`
- `bash tests/e2e/workspace-helper-wiring-check.sh`
- During code review of new skills, check whether workspace helper usage or equivalent INDEX.md append logic is included

**Retirement Trigger**
- When all skills that write to docs/aegis/ invoke the shared workspace helper and verification-before-completion checks helper output for touched workspaces in real target-project usage

---

### 2.7 Lazy Workspace Support Depends on Correct Triggering

**Retained Item**
- Workspace records are created lazily, not for every Aegis-assisted turn

**Retention Reason**
- Normal Q&A, simple explanation, version/status checks, and low-risk small edits should not create project files. Baseline/spec/plan/work records are written only when the workflow needs persistent project evidence

**Observation Metric**
- `bash tests/e2e/project-bootstrap-policy-check.sh`
- Actual hit rate of mid-stream escalation into baseline/spec/plan/work records

**Retirement Trigger**
- When a future runtime core can observe task state and trigger workspace support without relying on method-layer judgment

---

### 2.8 Project Baseline Bootstrap Depends on Sufficient Project Content

**Retained Item**
- Initial project baseline semantic quality depends on bounded repo scan results and sufficient project content

**Retention Reason**
- Aegis can index files, read key docs, infer owners/contracts, and create a structured baseline, but sparse repos or placeholder-only projects do not contain enough evidence for a useful baseline

**Observation Metric**
- Whether agents skip empty baselines when content is too sparse
- Whether generated baseline snapshots cite concrete files and commands instead of generic guesses

**Retirement Trigger**
- When real target-project usage shows the bootstrap consistently creates useful baseline snapshots or correctly declines sparse projects

---

### 2.9 BASELINE-GOVERNANCE.md Template Depends on Correct Agent Execution

**Retained Item**
- The content quality of BASELINE-GOVERNANCE.md still depends on the agent or workflow choosing the correct target project and preserving project-specific review

**Retention Reason**
- `<aegis-workspace-helper> init` now writes the standard baseline governance template and `check` verifies required headings and boundary phrases, but it cannot judge whether a target project's later edits are semantically sufficient

**Observation Metric**
- `bash tests/e2e/aegis-workspace-check.sh`
- Field fill rate and semantic usefulness in actually created BASELINE-GOVERNANCE.md files

**Retirement Trigger**
- When verification-before-completion consistently runs the helper check for touched workspaces and real target-project usage shows the generated template is semantically sufficient

---

### 2.10 Copy-Only or Skills-Only Installs Do Not Prove Complete Workspace Support

**Retained Item**
- Copy-only / skills-only install paths can prove skill discovery but may not prove complete project workspace support

**Retention Reason**
- Some hosts support only copying `skills/` into a native discovery directory. That keeps workflows usable, but the repo-local workspace support scripts may not be discoverable unless the method-pack root remains available or is configured

**Observation Metric**
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`
- JSON readback includes `"workspaceSupport": "available"` and
  `"configStatus": "configured"`
- Host docs distinguish recommended complete install from compatibility fallback

**Retirement Trigger**
- When each supported host has a verified install path that preserves both skill discovery and project workspace support

---

### 2.11 Architecture Review: 7 Dimensions Partially Depend on Agent Qualitative Judgment

**Retained Item**
- Some dimensions among the 7 (especially Entropy flow, Cascade proliferation) depend on agent qualitative judgment and have no quantitative measurement tools

**Retention Reason**
- Quantitative architecture measurement requires specialized static analysis toolchains, currently beyond the method-pack scope

**Observation Metric**
- Consistency of qualitative judgments in actual architecture reviews; if contentious judgments appear frequently, quantitative baselines need to be introduced

**Retirement Trigger**
- When integrable quantitative architecture measurement tools become available

---

### 2.12 Host-Loaded Skill Freshness Depends on Install Chain

**Retained Item**
- A repository-local skill update does not prove the current AI coding host is
  already loading that updated skill content

**Retention Reason**
- Some hosts scan skills at startup, use a copied skills directory, or resolve a
  host-specific discovery path. Aegis can verify the method-pack checkout and
  optional discovery root, but the host may still require restart/reload before
  the updated hot path is active.

**Observation Metric**
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-update.py status --json`
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-update.py update --host <host> --json`
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --discovery-root <host-skill-discovery-root>`
- Host-specific restart/reload plus skill discovery smoke where available

For copy-based and direct-child link compatibility exposures, the current
updater can refresh the direct-child skill directories from the canonical
`skills/` tree, prune stale Aegis-managed exposure entries, and run the same
discovery-root structural readback through `aegis-doctor.py`. This remains
method-pack-side structural verification only; host restart/reload may still be
required before the running host loads the refreshed content.

When `~/.config/aegis/config.toml` declares `method_pack_root`, the shared
updater now prefers that canonical root for new host registration defaults.
Multiple registered hosts may therefore share one method-pack checkout while
keeping different discovery roots, discovery shapes, reload hints, and
host-managed adapter behaviors.

When a host-scoped updater registration needs both transport and visibility
semantics, keep them separate:

- `syncMode` describes how Aegis reaches the host surface
- `discoveryShape` describes what the host should see there, such as
  `umbrella-root` or `direct-child`
- `discoveryNamePrefix` describes an optional host-visible direct-child
  directory name prefix, such as Copilot's repository skill view using
  `aegis-<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

Do not overload `syncMode` alone to carry transport, shape, and naming
semantics.

The update registry is host-scoped. Plain `aegis:update` should update the
current host installation only; all-host updates require an explicit `--all`
request.

**Retirement Trigger**
- When each supported host has a verified install/update path that proves both
  skill discovery and current hot-path content after reload

---

### 2.13 Hot-Path Budget Requires Continuous Guardrails

**Retained Item**
- `using-aegis` must stay a compact router instead of becoming the container for
  every Aegis workflow detail

**Retention Reason**
- Overloading the always-loaded entrypoint increases context pressure and can
  reduce task quality. Detailed rules belong in task-specific skills or
  references, not the hot path.

**Observation Metric**
- `bash tests/e2e/context-budget-check.sh`
- `using-aegis` hot-path character count
- Absence of helper command details and universal design/spec ceremony wording
  in the hot path

**Retirement Trigger**
- This is an ongoing guardrail rather than a defect to delete; future runtime
  support may replace the method-layer budget check with host/runtime telemetry.

---

### 2.14 ADR Auto Backfill Helper Exists, But Baseline Sync Still Depends On Workflow Judgment

**Retained Item**
- Helper-backed `new-adr`, `amend-adr`, and `supersede-adr` commands now exist,
  but they only scaffold target-project `docs/aegis/adr/` records and validate
  structure
- The semantic decision to create, amend, supersede, or skip an ADR, plus the
  truth of baseline sync closure, still depends on workflow judgment against the
  current authority docs

**Retention Reason**
- The repository now has helper-backed ADR lifecycle commands, owner-surface
  skill wiring, and e2e coverage, but those commands intentionally stop at
  structural method-pack support. `recording-architecture-decisions` and
  `verification-before-completion` still own ADR trigger judgment, owner-surface
  choice, and baseline sync closure

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/current/AEGIS_ADR_AUTO_BACKFILL.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/aegis-workspace-check.sh`
- `bash tests/e2e/workspace-helper-wiring-check.sh`
- `bash tests/e2e/workflow-quality-check.sh`
- Review of actual completion notes for explicit ADR Backfill and Baseline Sync
  closure when durable architecture surfaces changed

**Retirement Trigger**
- When real target-project usage shows helper-backed ADR writeback and baseline
  sync closure happen reliably without stale docs, skipped routing, or
  authority confusion

---

### 2.15 Antigravity CLI Is The Active Closeout Target, But Fresh Host Closeout Is Still Pending

**Retained Item**
- `Antigravity CLI` is the active Google-host closeout target, but still has no
  fresh Aegis host closeout verdict
- `Antigravity CLI` remains the active closeout target inside the current
  Google-host slice
- `Antigravity IDE` and `Antigravity App` remain structural target surfaces,
  not release-level fresh smoke verdicts

**Retention Reason**
- Google positions Antigravity as the successor Google agent platform and
  documents public capabilities such as Skills, MCP, JSON Hooks, plugins,
  slash commands, subagents, and the `agy` executable. The public docs now show
  `agy plugin list`, `agy plugin install /path/to/local/plugin`, and
  `agy plugin import gemini`. The public Antigravity CLI `1.0.1` changelog says
  plugin discovery for skills and agents from installed plugin directories
  exists, and the public `1.0.8` changelog also says custom skills and system
  slash commands reload dynamically on conversation switch or `/add-dir`.
- Those signals make `Antigravity CLI` the best next closeout target, but the
  stable local install / discovery contract for this Aegis method pack still
  needs current release verification before Aegis can claim host closeout.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.antigravity.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/antigravity-host-boundary-check.sh`
- `bash tests/antigravity/run-tests.sh`
- `bash tests/antigravity/run-tests.sh --integration`
- Future Antigravity CLI install smoke that proves skill discovery, restart or
  reload behavior, and
  `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`

**Retirement Trigger**
- When `Antigravity CLI` has a verified install/update path that proves both
  skill discovery and project workspace support without turning Aegis into an
  authoritative runtime core
- `Antigravity IDE` and `Antigravity App` should retire or reclassify through
  their own fresh evidence slices rather than piggybacking on CLI proof

---

### 2.16 Gemini CLI Support Is Retired

**Retired Item**
- The root `GEMINI.md`, `gemini-extension.json`, and Gemini-specific tool
  mapping have been removed from the supported distribution surface

**Retirement Reason**
- Google announced on `2026-05-19` that consumer Gemini CLI and Gemini Code
  Assist IDE extension usage is transitioning to Antigravity CLI and
  Antigravity 2.0. On `2026-06-18`, requests stop being served for free usage,
  Google AI Pro / Ultra, and Gemini Code Assist for individuals. Enterprise
  Standard / Enterprise, Google Cloud-backed Gemini Code Assist for GitHub, and
  paid Gemini / Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform API key paths remain outside
  that consumer stop boundary.
- Aegis has nevertheless chosen to stop carrying a separate Gemini CLI host
  adapter and to focus new Google-host work on Antigravity surfaces.

**Compatibility Impact**
- Existing enterprise, Google Cloud, or paid API-key Gemini CLI users may still
  be able to run Gemini CLI itself, but Aegis no longer publishes or verifies a
  Gemini CLI install path for them.
- This retirement does not establish a fresh Antigravity host closeout verdict.

**Verification**
- `docs/current/AEGIS_HOST_COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX_SNAPSHOT.md`
- `docs/README.antigravity.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/antigravity-host-boundary-check.sh`
- Repository scans show no current Gemini adapter, manifest, or tool-map owner

---

### 2.17 OpenClaw and Hermes Agent Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- OpenClaw and Hermes Agent are structural host targets, not release-level fresh
  smoke verdicts

**Retention Reason**
- OpenClaw documents `openclaw skills install` for Git and local skill
  directories whose source root contains `SKILL.md`. That supports Aegis
  individual skill-directory installs, but not a canonical whole-repo
  `git:GanyuanRan/Aegis` install because Aegis is a multi-skill method pack.
- Hermes Agent exposes a Skills Hub, a documented `~/.hermes/skills/` local
  skill path, GitHub path installs such as
  `hermes skills install owner/repo/skills/my-workflow`, and built-in
  coding-agent delegation skills. Aegis still needs current release live smoke
  before claiming host closeout.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.openclaw.md`
- `docs/README.hermes-agent.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/popular-agent-host-boundary-check.sh`
- Future OpenClaw and Hermes Agent install smoke that proves skill discovery,
  restart or reload behavior, and
  `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`

**Retirement Trigger**
- When OpenClaw and Hermes Agent each have a verified install/update path that
  proves both skill discovery and project workspace support without turning
  Aegis into an authoritative runtime core

---

### 2.18 Pi CLI Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- Pi CLI is a structural host target, not release-level fresh smoke verdict

**Retention Reason**
- Pi documents Agent Skills discovery from `~/.pi/agent/skills/`,
  `~/.agents/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`, package `skills/` directories or
  `pi.skills` entries in `package.json`, and explicit CLI skill paths.
- Pi package management supports git package installs such as
  `pi install git:github.com/GanyuanRan/Aegis`. Aegis now exposes `./skills`
  through the repository root `package.json`, but a current Pi runtime smoke is
  still required before claiming host closeout.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.pi.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/pi-host-boundary-check.sh`
- Future Pi install smoke that proves `pi install git:github.com/GanyuanRan/Aegis`,
  skill discovery after restart or `/reload`, and
  `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`

**Retirement Trigger**
- When Pi CLI has a verified install/update path that proves both skill
  discovery and project workspace support without turning Aegis into an
  authoritative runtime core

---

### 2.19 OMP Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- OMP (Oh My Pi) is a structural host target, not release-level fresh smoke
  verdict

**Retention Reason**
- OMP is a fork of Pi that keeps Agent Skills discovery. Its `agents` provider
  reads `~/.agents/skills/`, so the shared Aegis copy-based skill view is
  visible to OMP without OMP-specific packaging.
- OMP honors `alwaysApply: true` skill frontmatter (full content injected into
  the system prompt), which Aegis now uses for `using-aegis`.
- OMP auto-discovers extensions under `~/.omp/agent/extensions/` and accepts
  `omp.extensions` / `pi.extensions` package manifests; Aegis ships an
  `extensions/` bundle (`extensions/shared/` core + `extensions/omp/` adapter)
  shared with the Pi extension.
- A current OMP runtime smoke is still required before claiming host closeout.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.omp.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/omp-host-boundary-check.sh`
- Future OMP install smoke that proves `~/.agents/skills/` discovery,
  `alwaysApply` injection of `using-aegis`, and extension loading from
  `~/.omp/agent/extensions/`

**Retirement Trigger**
- When OMP has a verified install path that proves both skill discovery and
  `alwaysApply` / extension injection without turning Aegis into an
  authoritative runtime core

---

### 2.20 CC GUI Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- CC GUI is a structural JetBrains IDEA host target, not release-level fresh
  smoke verdict

**Retention Reason**
- CC GUI wraps Claude Code and an OpenAI/GPT provider path behind an IDE plugin
  UI. Its OpenAI/Codex provider skill scanner uses `.agents/skills/` style
  roots and expects each direct child skill directory to contain `SKILL.md`.
- Aegis is a multi-skill method pack. For CC GUI's OpenAI/GPT provider path,
  expose individual skills as `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` rather
  than relying only on an umbrella `~/.agents/skills/aegis` directory.
- When this direct-child exposure is needed, the method-pack `skills/` tree
  remains the canonical source of truth. Any additional exposure under
  `~/.agents/skills/` is a generated compatibility view, not a second editable
  skill owner.
- Selecting a specific GPT model profile inside CC GUI does not by itself
  change this skill discovery shape.
- User-visible entries such as `Tool: exec_command` are host adapter event
  rendering / host adapter event normalization concerns. Aegis can reduce
  unnecessary tool fan-out through workflow discipline, but it does not own CC
  GUI's visual folding, grouping, suppression, or live IDE event model.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.cc-gui.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/cc-gui-host-boundary-check.sh`
- Future CC GUI install smoke that proves direct skill discovery, restart or
  reload behavior, OpenAI/GPT and Claude Code provider behavior where relevant,
  and
  `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`

**Retirement Trigger**
- When CC GUI has a verified install/update path that proves both skill
  discovery and project workspace support, and when any IDE rendering claims
  are backed by direct CC GUI evidence rather than Aegis method-pack tests
  alone

---

### 2.21 GitHub Copilot Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- GitHub Copilot is a structural host target, not a release-level fresh smoke
  verdict

**Retention Reason**
- GitHub Copilot documents repository-scoped agent skills under
  `.github/skills/`, repository custom instructions under
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, repository hooks under
  `.github/hooks/*.json`, and project guidance through `AGENTS.md`.
- Those surfaces are enough for Aegis method-pack exposure, but current
  release-level live host smoke is still required before claiming host
  closeout.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.copilot.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/copilot-qoder-host-boundary-check.sh`
- Future GitHub Copilot install smoke that proves skill discovery, repository
  instruction visibility, and
  `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`

**Retirement Trigger**
- When GitHub Copilot has a verified install/update path that proves both skill
  discovery and project workspace support without turning Aegis into an
  authoritative runtime core

---

### 2.22 Qoder Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- Qoder is a structural host target, not a release-level fresh smoke verdict

**Retention Reason**
- Qoder documents native skills under `~/.qoder/skills/` and `.qoder/skills/`,
  project rules under `.qoder/rules/`, and repository guidance through
  `AGENTS.md`.
- Those surfaces are enough for Aegis method-pack exposure, but current
  release-level live host smoke is still required before claiming host
  closeout.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.qoder.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/copilot-qoder-host-boundary-check.sh`
- Future Qoder install smoke that proves skill discovery, rules visibility, and
  `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`

**Retirement Trigger**
- When Qoder has a verified install/update path that proves both skill
  discovery and project workspace support without turning Aegis into an
  authoritative runtime core

---

### 2.23 Kimi Code CLI Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- Kimi Code CLI is a structural host target, not a release-level fresh smoke
  verdict
- The default automatic path is the Kimi-managed plugin with
  `sessionStart.skill = using-aegis`; deterministic tests verify its manifest,
  doctor profile, and duplicate-exposure rejection, but not live model routing
- Updater-managed `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/` direct-child exposure is retained
  as explicit compatibility installation, not as the default automatic path
- The generic `~/.agents/skills/` Kimi scan root is retained only as an
  official fallback, not as the Aegis Kimi canonical install path

**Retention Reason**
- Official Kimi Code CLI Agent Skills docs list user-level skill roots as
  `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/` (`~/.kimi-code/skills/` by default) and
  `~/.agents/skills/`. They also list project-level `.kimi-code/skills/` and
  `.agents/skills/`.
- Kimi's plugin contract provides a stable session-start owner that plain skill
  discovery does not provide. The thin manifest reuses the canonical `skills/`
  tree rather than copying Kimi-only skill bodies.
- For explicit compatibility installs, expose individual skills as
  `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` rather than relying on the
  Codex umbrella symlink
  `~/.agents/skills/aegis -> ~/.codex/aegis/skills`.
- The method-pack `skills/` tree remains the canonical source of truth. Kimi
  plugin content and compatibility directories are host-managed or generated
  views, not second editable skill owners.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.kimi-code.md`
- `bash tests/kimi-code/run-tests.sh`
- `bash tests/kimi-code/run-tests.sh --integration`
- `bash tests/kimi-code/run-live-smoke.sh`
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-update.py register --host kimi-code --sync-mode junction --json`
  remains the explicit compatibility registration path
- `python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --json --host-profile kimi-code-auto` verifies
  the managed plugin owner, version, session-start entry, and absence of
  direct-child collisions without mutating Kimi state
- Release-level live Kimi Code CLI smoke is still required to prove automatic
  task routing after `/reload` or `/new`, resumed-session routing, and
  acceptable false-positive behavior

**Retirement Trigger**
- When a fresh release-level Kimi run proves plugin install/update, new and
  resumed session routing, false-positive control, and project workspace
  support without turning Aegis into an authoritative runtime core

---

### 2.24 ZCode Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- ZCode is a structural host target, not release-level fresh smoke verdict

**Retention Reason**
- ZCode's skill scanner reads each root's direct subdirectories and expects
  `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (depth-1, like CC GUI and Windsurf).
  An umbrella `~/.agents/skills/aegis/` directory does not expose Aegis skills
  to ZCode. Use the updater-managed direct-child install documented in
  `docs/README.zcode.md`.
- ZCode also documents a plugin marketplace that natively reads
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (Claude Code plugin format), `SKILL.md`
  skills invoked through the `@`-prefix picker, and repository guidance
  through `AGENTS.md`.
- Because ZCode natively reads the Claude Code plugin format, Aegis's existing
  `.claude-plugin/` skeleton works with zero code changes. Current
  release-level live host smoke is still required before claiming host
  closeout.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.zcode.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/zcode-host-boundary-check.sh`
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-update.py register --host zcode --sync-mode junction --discovery-root ~/.agents/skills --json`
  now performs register-time direct-child link creation, registry write, and
  method-pack-side doctor verification
- Release-level live ZCode smoke is still required to prove plugin marketplace
  install, `@`-prefix skill discovery after reload, and current hot-path loading
  inside the running host

**Retirement Trigger**
- When ZCode has a verified install/update path that proves both skill
  discovery and project workspace support without turning Aegis into an
  authoritative runtime core

---

### 2.25 Grok Build Structural Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- Grok Build is a structural host target, not a release-level fresh smoke
  verdict
- Grok's native skills, extra `[skills] paths`, shared Agent Skills, and
  Claude-compatible plugin scanners can expose duplicate Aegis skill names

**Retention Reason**
- Grok documents native user skills under `$GROK_HOME/skills/`
  (`~/.grok/skills/` by default), project `.grok/skills/`, extra skill paths in
  `~/.grok/config.toml`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `AGENTS.md`, and Claude Code
  compatibility surfaces.
- Aegis now recommends updater-managed direct-child skill exposure under the
  Grok native user root. The method-pack `skills/` tree remains canonical; the
  Grok-visible entries are generated links, not a second editable owner.
- An explicit `[skills] paths` entry or Claude-compatible Aegis plugin remains
  a valid alternative. Enabling more than one Aegis exposure route can produce
  duplicate skill names with different freshness.
- Local `grok inspect --json` evidence confirms that Grok Build can enumerate
  Aegis skills and project instructions, but it is not a clean-install,
  restart/reload, automatic-trigger, and update closeout for the release.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.grok-build.md`
- `bash tests/e2e/grok-build-host-boundary-check.sh`
- `python tests/helpers/test_aegis_update.py -k grok`
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-update.py register --host grok-build --sync-mode junction --json`
  uses `$GROK_HOME/skills` or `~/.grok/skills` as the default discovery root,
  performs register-time direct-child link creation, writes the host registry
  entry, and runs method-pack-side doctor verification
- `grok inspect --json` reports one canonical source for each Aegis skill name

**Retirement Trigger**
- When a clean Grok Build install has a verified install/update path that
  proves current Aegis skill discovery, representative live triggering after
  restart, no duplicate Aegis exposure, and project workspace support
  without turning Aegis into an authoritative runtime core

### 2.26 DeepSeek Harness Bundle Support Is Not Yet Fresh Host Closeout

**Retained Item**
- The official DeepSeek Harness (`deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`) is a structural
  host target, not a release-level fresh smoke verdict
- DeepSeek Harness and the community DeepSeek-TUI remain separate host surfaces
- Deterministic tests cover native lifecycle bootstrap wiring, but not live
  model routing quality in a fresh installed DSH profile
- The updater-managed direct-child install remains an explicit compatibility
  path rather than the default DSH installation

**Retention Reason**
- The default DSH path is a thin package bundle declared through
  `dsh.bundle.patch`. It registers the canonical package-owned `skills/` tree
  through Harness's native filesystem provider. In `auto` mode it preloads the
  compact router text while applying the plugin and defers its injection to
  the session's first durable promotion signal (`tool/call` or
  `assistant/message`) after each native `agent/session-start` boundary
  (`startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact`), keeping the first model request
  of every gated epoch free of injected context while avoiding a first-step
  asynchronous read race.
- The bootstrap skips subagents and does not install a hard pre-tool guard:
- DeepSeek Harness's native filesystem provider discovers direct child skill
  bundles from project `.dsh/skills`, project `.agents/skills`, configured
  custom directories, `$DSH_HOME/skills` (`~/.dsh/skills` by default), and
  `$DSH_AGENTS_HOME/skills`.
- Direct-child exposure remains necessary when the developer-preview bundle API
  is unavailable, local policy forbids third-party profile plugins, or `pnpm`
  cannot be provided to the DSH plugin manager. The method-pack `skills/` tree
  remains canonical; DSH-visible entries are generated links rather than a
  second editable owner.
- Enabling project, native user, shared Agent Skills, or custom Aegis exposure
  at the same time as the bundle can produce duplicate skill names with
  different freshness.
- The official host is a developer preview and explicitly warns that
  compatibility-breaking changes are expected. Native catalog discovery and
  lifecycle entry are structurally covered; automatic task-specific routing,
  false-positive behavior, session refresh, and update behavior still need
  fresh live verification.

**Observation Metric**
- `docs/README.deepseek-harness.md`
- `bash tests/deepseek-harness/run-tests.sh`
- `bash tests/deepseek-harness/run-tests.sh --integration`
- a clean `dsh plugin --profile web add github:GanyuanRan/Aegis` readback lists
  `aegis` in `dsh.profile.bundles` and `dsh --profile web --dump-config` contains
  exactly one enabled `aegis-method-pack` row
- `python tests/helpers/test_aegis_update.py -k deepseek_harness`
- `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-update.py register --host deepseek-harness --compatibility-mode --sync-mode junction --json`
  uses `$DSH_HOME/skills` or `~/.dsh/skills` as the default discovery root,
  performs register-time direct-child link creation, writes the host registry
  entry, and runs method-pack-side doctor verification
- A fresh DeepSeek Harness Standard-mode session receives the native bootstrap
  and either loads the appropriate task-specific skill or declares
  `Route: fast-path`, from exactly one canonical exposure

**Retirement Trigger**
- Re-evaluate the direct-child compatibility path after a stable DeepSeek
  Harness release and two consecutive Aegis releases have verified bundle
  install/update, representative live triggering, session refresh, no duplicate
  exposure, and project workspace support. Until then it remains an explicit
  compatibility path, not a co-active fallback.

### 2.27 Six-Topology Diagnosis Assumes Acyclic Convergence On Discrete Mechanisms

**Retained Item**
- The `systematic-debugging` Causal Topology Gate classifies root claims into
  six acyclic shapes over discrete causes (`single-root`,
  `single-root-multi-symptom`, `chain`, `independent-compound`,
  `conjunctive-cluster`, `disjunctive-or`)
- Cyclic / feedback causation such as race conditions, retry storms, or cache
  invalidation loops, and emergent causes where the root is a relation between
  components rather than a mechanism node, are not yet first-class topology
  categories; current guidance force-fits such cases into `chain` or
  `conjunctive-cluster`
- Diagnostic layers L1-L7 are observation altitudes and remain valid entry
  points for these cases; only the topology vocabulary is incomplete

**Mitigation Today**
- When member-by-member repair keeps regenerating the symptom, the
  three-failed-fixes architecture escalation (`advanced-debugging-governance.md`)
  is the intended exit rather than adding another cluster member

**Promotion Trigger**
- A seventh topology becomes eligible only with a real worked replay case
  showing that force-fit classification caused a misrepair, plus the same
  matrix-sample and validator evidence standard the existing six topologies met

## 3. Default Reading Rule

If a limitation appears simultaneously in README, host docs, or test descriptions, use this document as the current reading entry point.

## 4. Architecture Review

The core requirements for current limitation management are:

1. Do not conceal limitations
2. Do not write limitations as permanent defects
3. Do not add fallbacks without retirement plans in order to mask limitations

For the 7-dimension operational definitions and defect/drift judgment criteria for architecture review, see `AEGIS_PROCESS_BASELINE.md` §15-§17.
