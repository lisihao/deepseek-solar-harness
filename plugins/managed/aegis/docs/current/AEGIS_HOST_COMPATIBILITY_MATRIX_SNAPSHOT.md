# Aegis Host Compatibility Matrix Snapshot

Status: `Reviewed`

## 1. Document Scope

This document records the current host compatibility snapshot of the `Aegis Method Pack`.

It answers:

- Which hosts have fresh evidence
- Which hosts only have structural goals without current fresh verification
- What is the reading order for the current compatibility verdict

It does not answer:

- Permanent support commitments for all hosts
- Complete platform-level runtime compatibility

---

## 2. Snapshot Date

The current snapshot is based on fresh evidence and current docs landed as of
`2026-07-23`.

---

## 3. Current Verdict

### 3.1 Hosts With Fresh Evidence

| Host | Current Verdict | Evidence Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Codex` | Representative smoke mainline available; naive smoke under Git Bash still requires observation | `docs/testing.md`, `tests/skill-triggering/*`, `tests/explicit-skill-requests/*`, `docs/current/AEGIS_KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` |
| `OpenCode` | Base suite and integration closeout passed | `docs/testing.md`, `tests/opencode/*`, `docs/README.opencode.md`; current mainline prefers the configured `method_pack_root` as the canonical Aegis body and treats the OpenCode-visible skills tree as a generated host view |

### 3.2 Hosts Without a Current Fresh Release Verdict

| Host | Current Status | Why Not Yet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Claude Code` | Has install guide and plugin skeleton; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.claude-code.md` established, but real host regression is still deferred |
| `CC GUI (JetBrains IDEA)` | Structural IDE plugin layer target for Claude Code / OpenAI-GPT provider paths; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.cc-gui.md` established; CC GUI's OpenAI/Codex provider scanner expects direct `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` skill directories regardless of the selected GPT model profile, so Aegis must expose individual skills rather than only an umbrella `~/.agents/skills/aegis` directory; live IDE plugin smoke and host adapter event rendering remain deferred |
| `CodeBuddy` | Has `.codebuddy-plugin/` skeleton and native `SKILL.md` manual install instructions; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.codebuddy.md` established; evidence from CodeBuddy skills/plugin docs and this repo's `.codebuddy-plugin/`; real host regression still deferred |
| `DeepSeek-TUI` | Native `SKILL.md` discovery supports manual installation; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.deepseek-tui.md` established; evidence from DeepSeek-TUI README/source discovery contract; real host regression still deferred |
| `DeepSeek Harness` | Native DSH bundle installation, filesystem skill discovery, and lifecycle router bootstrap support structural install; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.deepseek-harness.md` established; the default path is the thin Aegis `dsh.bundle`, which registers the package-owned `skills/` tree and defers a compact router bootstrap, armed at native `agent/session-start` boundaries and injected after the session's first durable promotion signal; updater-managed direct-child exposure under `$DSH_HOME/skills` remains an explicit compatibility mode without that bootstrap; the official host remains a developer preview with compatibility-breaking changes expected, and it is separate from DeepSeek-TUI |
| `Trae` | Native `SKILL.md` discovery supports manual installation; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.trae.md` established; evidence from Trae skills docs; real host regression still deferred |
| `GitHub Copilot` | Supports repository skills, instructions, and hooks; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.copilot.md` established; evidence from GitHub Copilot agent skills, repository instructions, and hooks docs; Aegis exposes repository skills as `.github/skills/aegis-<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, verified as a prefixed direct-child compatibility view, but real host regression is still deferred |
| `Qoder` | Native `SKILL.md` discovery and rules surfaces support structural install; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.qoder.md` established; evidence from Qoder skills and rules docs, but real host regression is still deferred |
| `Kimi Code CLI` | Native plugin bootstrap and Agent Skills discovery are structurally supported; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.kimi-code.md` established; the default automatic path uses root `kimi.plugin.json` with `sessionStart.skill = using-aegis`; updater-managed direct-child exposure under `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/` (`~/.kimi-code/skills/` by default) remains the explicit compatibility mode, while `~/.agents/skills/` is only a shared fallback; these exposure routes must not be enabled together |
| `Grok Build` | Native Agent Skills, `AGENTS.md`, extra `[skills] paths`, and Claude-compatible plugin discovery support structural install; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.grok-build.md` established; updater-managed direct-child exposure defaults to `$GROK_HOME/skills/` (`~/.grok/skills/` by default), while config-path and Claude-plugin discovery remain alternatives that must not be enabled as duplicate Aegis owners; local `grok inspect --json` evidence confirms enumeration but not clean-install or live-trigger closeout |
| `Cursor` | Has `.cursor/INSTALL.md` install guide; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | Structural goal established; not yet entered the current host regression slice |
| `Windsurf` | Has `.windsurf/INSTALL.md` install guide; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | Structural goal established; not yet entered the current host regression slice |
| `Antigravity CLI` | Active closeout target; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | Google positions Antigravity CLI as the successor terminal surface with the `agy` executable, plugin/skills management, migration import from Gemini CLI, and documented plugin discovery for skills and agents from installed plugin directories in the public `1.0.1` changelog; the public `1.0.8` changelog also adds dynamic custom-skill discovery improvements. Aegis now has a dedicated `tests/antigravity/run-tests.sh` lane, but the method-pack install / discovery contract still needs fresh local verification |
| `Antigravity IDE` | Structural target retained; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | Google positions Antigravity IDE as an editor surface with global or workspace-specific Skills, MCPs, and JSON Hooks; this shape is not the active closeout slice and still needs fresh verification |
| `Antigravity App` | Structural target retained; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | Google Antigravity 2.x app / project platform can carry Aegis method-pack projections, but this shape is not the active closeout slice and no live host closeout has been run |
| `Pi CLI` | Agent Skills and Pi package surface supports method-pack exposure; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | Pi documents skill discovery from `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.pi/skills/`, package `skills/` directories or `pi.skills` entries, and `pi install git:github.com/GanyuanRan/Aegis` package installs; Aegis now ships a Pi extension (`pi.extensions` manifest entry) that injects the compact using-aegis hot path and a routing guard through Pi's `context`/`tool_call`/`tool_result` events; Aegis still needs current release live smoke before claiming host closeout |
| `OMP (Oh My Pi)` | Agent Skills `agents` provider (`~/.agents/skills/`), `alwaysApply` frontmatter, and extension loading support structural exposure; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.omp.md` established; OMP is a fork of Pi that discovers `~/.agents/skills/`, honors `alwaysApply: true` (full content injected into the system prompt), auto-discovers `~/.omp/agent/extensions/`, and accepts `omp.extensions` / `pi.extensions` package manifests; Aegis marks `using-aegis` with `alwaysApply` and ships an `omp.extensions` bundle, but live OMP smoke is still deferred |
| `OpenClaw` | Native `SKILL.md` skill installer supports local skill directories; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.openclaw.md` established; evidence from OpenClaw `openclaw skills install` docs that Git/local installs expect `SKILL.md` at the source root; Aegis is multi-skill, so individual skill-directory install is the structural path pending live smoke |
| `Hermes Agent` | Skills Hub / `~/.hermes/skills/` skill host surface supports method-pack exposure; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.hermes-agent.md` established; evidence from Hermes Skills Hub, documented local skills path, GitHub path installs, and built-in coding delegation skills; live host regression still deferred |
| `ZCode` | Depth-1 `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` skill discovery (like CC GUI and Windsurf) plus Claude-Code-compatible plugin marketplace reading `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`; direct-child exposure is now updater-maintained at register/update time; reads `AGENTS.md`; no current release-level fresh smoke verdict | `docs/README.zcode.md` established; evidence from ZCode plugin and skill official docs; Aegis's existing `.claude-plugin/` skeleton works with zero code changes, but live host regression still deferred |

### 3.2a Retired Host Surfaces

| Host | Current Status | Retirement Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Gemini CLI` | Retired; unsupported by Aegis | Google announced the consumer transition on `2026-05-19`; service stopped on `2026-06-18` for free usage, Google AI Pro / Ultra, and Gemini Code Assist for individuals, while Enterprise Standard / Enterprise, Google Cloud, and paid API-key paths remained outside that boundary. Aegis no longer ships `GEMINI.md`, `gemini-extension.json`, or a Gemini-specific tool mapping. This is an explicit Aegis product-support retirement rather than a claim that Gemini CLI no longer exists. Historical migration guidance remains in `docs/README.antigravity.md`. |

### 3.3 Hosts Requiring No Independent Adapter

| Host | Current Status | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Warp` | No independent adapter needed | As a terminal host, Warp runs third-party CLI agents (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode) and does not provide its own skills system |

### 3.4 Trigger-Family Vocabulary

The current docs may refer to these trigger families as a compact compatibility
aid:

- `hook-bootstrap`
- `native-direct-skill`
- `provider-hybrid`

This vocabulary is advisory and diagnostic only. It does **not** replace
host-specific docs as the canonical owner for install roots, reload behavior,
or supported discovery shapes.

---

## 4. What This Snapshot Means

The current snapshot only states:

1. `Codex` and `OpenCode` are the two mainlines with the most fresh evidence
   - `OpenCode` now prefers the configured `method_pack_root` as its canonical Aegis source when available, then generates the host-visible skills view from that source instead of treating the host cache as a second editable owner
2. `Kimi Code CLI` defaults to the native Aegis plugin declared by
   `kimi.plugin.json`, whose `sessionStart.skill = using-aegis` provides the
   automatic router entry; updater-maintained direct-child discovery under
   `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/skills/` (`~/.kimi-code/skills/` by default) remains an
   explicit compatibility mode, and `~/.agents/skills/` remains a shared
   fallback; exactly one route may be active, and fresh live routing evidence
   is still pending
3. `CC GUI (JetBrains IDEA)` can expose Aegis to its OpenAI/GPT provider path through direct `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` directories, but the selected GPT model profile does not by itself change the skill discovery shape, and live IDE plugin behavior, reload behavior, and `Tool: exec_command` rendering remain fresh-smoke pending
4. `CodeBuddy` can install Aegis via `.codebuddy-plugin/` or native `SKILL.md` discovery, but local CLI live smoke has not yet formed valid evidence
5. `DeepSeek-TUI` can manually install Aegis skills via native `SKILL.md` discovery, but `/skill install github:GanyuanRan/Aegis` is not the current canonical path
6. `Trae` can manually install Aegis skills via native `SKILL.md` discovery; `.agents/skills/` is an optional Trae capability, not Aegis's canonical Trae path
7. `GitHub Copilot` can expose Aegis through `.github/skills/aegis-<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/hooks/*.json`, and `AGENTS.md`; the prefixed repository skill view is a generated compatibility exposure over the canonical `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` tree, and support remains structural until a fresh Copilot install and agent smoke proves it for the current release
8. `Qoder` can expose Aegis through `~/.qoder/skills/`, `.qoder/skills/`, `.qoder/rules/`, and `AGENTS.md`, but support remains structural until a fresh Qoder install smoke proves it for the current release
9. `Cursor` and `Windsurf` have structured install guides but have not yet entered release-level fresh smoke
10. `Antigravity CLI` is now the active Google-host closeout target, but still lacks release-level fresh smoke evidence
11. `Antigravity IDE` and `Antigravity App` remain structural target surfaces rather than the active closeout slice
12. `Gemini CLI` support is retired; this does not upgrade Antigravity CLI, IDE,
    or App beyond their separately evidenced current status
13. `Pi CLI` can expose Aegis through `pi install git:github.com/GanyuanRan/Aegis`, Pi package `skills/` / `pi.skills` discovery, `~/.pi/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, or `.pi/skills/`, but support remains structural until a fresh Pi install smoke proves it for the current release
14. `OpenClaw` can expose Aegis through individual local skill-directory installs, but `git:owner/repo` should not be written as the canonical whole-repo Aegis installer because OpenClaw expects `SKILL.md` at the source root
15. `Hermes Agent` can expose Aegis through `~/.hermes/skills/` or documented GitHub path installs, but support remains structural until a fresh Hermes install smoke proves it for the current release
16. `ZCode` can expose Aegis through updater-maintained depth-1 `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` direct-child skill discovery (like CC GUI and Windsurf) and through its native `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` reading (Claude Code plugin format), so the existing Claude Code plugin skeleton works with zero code changes; support remains structural until a fresh ZCode install smoke proves it for the current release
17. `Warp`, as a terminal host, does not itself need an independent adapter
18. The current method-pack still retains the cross-host installation goal
19. "Support all plugin hosts" remains a product goal, not equivalent to "all hosts have current fresh closeout"
20. Some hosts may require a compatibility exposure shape that differs from a
    mainline host's canonical install shape; when that happens, the method-pack
    `skills/` tree remains the canonical source and the extra exposure should be
    treated as a generated compatibility view rather than a second editable
    owner
21. The shared local `~/.config/aegis/config.toml` may declare one canonical
    `method_pack_root`; when it does, new host registrations should prefer that
    root and treat host-specific discovery roots, plugin caches, or copied skill
    trees as generated or host-managed views into the same Aegis body
22. `Grok Build` can expose Aegis through updater-maintained direct-child
    skills under `$GROK_HOME/skills/` (`~/.grok/skills/` by default), an
    explicit `[skills] paths` entry, or Claude-compatible plugin discovery;
    these are alternative exposure routes, not three simultaneous owners, and
    support remains structural until clean-install and live-trigger smoke is
    fresh for the current release
23. `DeepSeek Harness` defaults to the thin Aegis `dsh.bundle`, installed and
    updated by the host profile plugin manager; the bundle mounts the
    package-owned `skills/` tree through Harness's native filesystem provider
    and, in `auto` mode, defers a compact `using-aegis` routing bootstrap that
    is armed at native `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, and `compact` session
    starts and injected once after the session's first durable promotion
    signal (`tool/call` or `assistant/message`), so the first model request of
    every gated epoch stays free of injected context. This is advisory
    model-facing context, not a hard tool guard or runtime authority.
    Updater-managed direct-child skills under
    `$DSH_HOME/skills` (`~/.dsh/skills` by default), project `.dsh/skills`,
    shared `.agents/skills`, and custom skill directories remain explicit
    compatibility alternatives without bundle bootstrap; exactly one Aegis
    exposure should be active, and structural catalog/bootstrap discovery is
    not a current live-routing verdict

## 6. Compatibility Boundary

The current snapshot only covers:

- Method-pack installation and distribution
- skill discovery / representative triggering
- Project workspace support when the installed method-pack root remains
  available and can be verified by
  `cd <aegis-method-pack-root> && python scripts/aegis-doctor.py --write-config --json`
- Host-scoped explicit update registration through
  `python scripts/aegis-update.py status --json` and
  `python scripts/aegis-update.py update --host <host> --json`
- Plugin loading / priority / distribution sync

The current snapshot does not cover:

- Runtime core integration
- Host adapter event normalization
- Complete live production workflow orchestration

Skill discovery and project workspace support are related but distinct. A
skills-only copy can make Aegis workflows visible to a host while failing to
prove complete project workspace support. A complete install should preserve
the method-pack root or equivalent configured support path so workspace
bootstrap, indexing, work records, and structural checks remain available.
Complete-install verification should write local helper paths and read back
`"ok": true`, `"workspaceSupport": "available"`, and `"configStatus":
"configured"` from `aegis-doctor.py`.

Do not run `aegis-doctor.py` from the target project directory. The script
belongs to the installed Aegis method-pack root; target projects are passed
separately to workspace helper commands with `--root <target-project-root>`.

## 7. Architecture Review

Three misjudgments must be avoided when reading this snapshot:

1. Mistaking the current pass of `Codex + OpenCode` for "all hosts have been formally closed out"
2. Mistaking current smoke / integration verdicts for full-platform readiness
3. Mistaking host compatibility work for elevating method-pack authority
